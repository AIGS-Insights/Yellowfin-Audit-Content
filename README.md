# Yellowfin-Audit-Content
Monitor your Yellowfin instance using Audit Content.

You can use the import feature to get any content into your Yellowfin instance. A YFX file is created during the EXPORT feature, which can then be imported into any Yellowfin instance.
You can import either a YFX file, or an XML file.

Note: The same process can be used to import any Yellowfin content into your instance, not just the Audit Content.

**For versions 9.12 and newer**
